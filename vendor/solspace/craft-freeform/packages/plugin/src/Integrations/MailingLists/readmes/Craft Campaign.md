## Setup Guide
The _Craft Campaign_ integration includes support for the following:

* Field mapping to regular text field types.
* Mapping to mailing lists from different Sites.

### Setup Instructions
Freeform will detect if _Campaign_ is installed and then show it as an option to use. Because it's a Craft plugin, setup is much simpler:

1. Setup Integration on your site:
	* Enter a name and handle for the integration.
	* Click the **Save** button.
2. Proceed to the form builder to setup the form.
